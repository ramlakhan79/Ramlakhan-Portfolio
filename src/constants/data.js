    desc: "React Server Components (RSC) introduce a different way of thinking about rendering. Instead of sending all the JavaScript to the browser, React can now handle part of the work on the server. This reduces bundle size and improves performance, especially for users on slow networks.\n\nThe biggest advantage is that server-only code never ships to the client. That means you can directly read files, query databases, or perform expensive operations without worrying about exposing credentials or impacting performance. The server prepares the UI and sends a lightweight version to the browser.\n\nAnother meaningful improvement is how RSC work with data fetching. Instead of using useEffect or client-side fetching libraries, components can fetch data on the server before rendering. This results in cleaner code and fewer network waterfalls.\n\nRSC also pair well with streaming. The server can send parts of the UI as they are ready, which gives users a faster-feeling interface. Instead of waiting for one big response, the page loads gradually.\n\nHowever, RSC aren’t a drop-in replacement for traditional components. Client-side interactivity still needs Client Components. The key is knowing when to use each. For example, forms, animations, and event-driven elements belong on the client. Anything related to data loading or heavy computation belongs on the server.\n\nRSC create a modern balance between performance and developer experience. They give you tools to build faster apps without complex setup.",

    title: "When To Use useMemo and useCallback",
    desc: "useMemo and useCallback are helpful, but many developers use them without fully understanding when they make sense. Both hooks reduce unnecessary re-renders, but they also add some overhead. The trick is knowing when the trade-off is worth it.\n\nuseMemo stores the result of an expensive calculation. Instead of running a heavy function on every render, React reuses the previously calculated value as long as the dependencies haven’t changed. This is useful when you’re working with large arrays, sorting data, computing derived values, or performing operations that take noticeable time.\n\nuseCallback works similarly, but it memorizes a function instead of a value. It’s especially helpful when passing functions as props to child components. Without useCallback, React creates a new function on each render, which might cause the child to re-render even if nothing changed.\n\nIt’s important not to wrap every function or calculation in these hooks. If the logic is simple, the cost of recalculating is lower than the cost of storing it.\n\nA good rule is: use these hooks when you notice performance issues, when the component re-renders too often, or when working with large data sets. Used properly, they help apps feel smoother and more efficient.",

    title: "A Practical Guide to Reusable React Components",
    desc: "Reusable components save time, reduce bugs, and keep code cleaner. The goal isn’t to build something extremely generic. It's to design components that cover common use cases without becoming too complex.\n\nStart with small building blocks. Buttons, inputs, cards, and modals are good examples. These can often accept a mix of props like size, color, disabled, or variant. Keep the API predictable so developers understand what to expect.\n\nFor components with more structure, like forms or layouts, consider using the composition pattern. Instead of giving dozens of props, let developers pass their own elements into the component. This gives more flexibility and keeps your code easier to maintain.\n\nStyling also matters. Tailwind helps by providing utility classes, but you can still expose className for customization. Avoid hardcoding spacing or colors that can't be changed.\n\nA reusable component should hide complexity and expose only what’s required. You don’t want developers to think about how it works internally. They should only care about how to use it.\n\nFinally, document everything. Even simple components benefit from examples. Reusability increases when people know how to use the component without guessing.",

    title: "Async/Await in JavaScript: Beyond the Basics",
    desc: "Async and await make asynchronous code easier to read, but there's more going on behind the scenes. When you mark a function as async, JavaScript wraps the return value in a promise. Using await pauses code execution in that function until the promise settles.\n\nOne common mistake is forgetting that await only blocks the current async function, not the rest of the program. JavaScript still runs other operations while waiting.\n\nAnother area developers overlook is error handling. Try/catch works well, but it can get messy when dealing with multiple async operations. Promise.all helps when tasks can run in parallel, but you need to consider what happens if one of them fails.\n\nAsync functions tie directly into the event loop. Promises resolve in the microtask queue, which runs before regular tasks. Understanding this helps you debug timing issues, especially when working with UI updates or repeated network calls.\n\nYou should also avoid awaiting things inside loops unless absolutely necessary. Running asynchronous tasks sequentially slows everything down. Instead, collect promises and wait for them together.\n\nAsync/await simplifies your code, but using it correctly makes your applications smoother, faster, and easier to reason about.",

    title: "Understanding Closures With Real Examples",
    desc: "Closures allow a function to remember values from its parent scope even after that parent function has finished running. This simple idea powers many useful JavaScript patterns.\n\nA common example is a function that returns another function. The inner function can still access variables defined outside of it.\n\nClosures are also used in event handlers. When you attach a listener inside a loop, closures help you preserve the correct values.\n\nAnother practical use is function factories. You can create small reusable functions that share logic. Memoization is another area where closures shine. You store previous results inside a closed-over scope so the function can return cached values faster.\n\nClosures can cause memory issues if not used carefully. Unintentionally capturing large objects or DOM references keeps them in memory longer than needed.\n\nOnce you understand closures, patterns like currying, debounce, and throttle become easier to grasp. They are not just a theoretical concept — they solve real problems in everyday JavaScript.",

Vite is built around native ES modules and uses a faster build pipeline.\n\nThe development server is where you feel the biggest difference. Webpack rebuilds and bundles everything on file changes. Vite only updates the modules that changed, making the refresh almost instant.\n\nMigrating usually starts with moving your entry file, adjusting alias settings, and replacing loaders with Vite plugins. Since Vite uses Rollup under the hood for production builds, you gain efficient tree-shaking and clean output bundles.\n\nOne thing to consider is plugin compatibility. Some Webpack plugins won’t work directly, but Vite has a large plugin ecosystem that covers most use cases.\n\nWith Vite, you also get first-class TypeScript support, faster HMR, and simpler configuration. The developer experience improves immediately.",

This removes unused code and keeps the bundle smaller.\n\nThe bundling steps include dependency pre-bundling, code splitting, asset optimization, and generating separate chunks for libraries. Vite also handles dynamic imports cleanly.\n\nFor CSS, Vite extracts styles and minimizes them. Image assets get hashed names to improve caching.\n\nThe outcome is a faster, stable build with predictable output.",

However, its plugin ecosystem is smaller.\n\nSWC is written in Rust and aims to replace Babel. It’s faster than Babel and supports most modern JavaScript features. Many bundlers now use it.\n\nBabel offers the most mature plugin system and transformations. If you need fine-grained control over your output or use cutting-edge syntax transformation, Babel still leads.\n\nChoosing between them depends on your project: speed, flexibility, and ecosystem matter differently in each case.",
